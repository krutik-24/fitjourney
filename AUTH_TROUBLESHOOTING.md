## Authentication Issue Resolution Guide

### Problem:
- Cookies are not being sent from browser to API endpoints
- "Token received: false" and "All cookies: []" in server logs
- Users getting 401 errors when submitting fitness profile

### Root Causes:
1. Cookie SameSite policy issues in development
2. Browser not persisting authentication cookies
3. Session timing out between login and profile submission

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Cookie Settings** (lib/auth.js)
   - More robust cookie configuration
   - Development-friendly settings

2. **Session Validation** (pages/fitness-profile.js)
   - Pre-submission authentication check
   - Automatic re-authentication if needed
   - Better error handling

3. **Debug Endpoints** (pages/api/auth/check.js)
   - Session status checking
   - Authentication debugging

### Manual Workaround for Users:
If authentication issues persist, users should:

1. **Log out and log back in** before completing profile
2. **Use the "Switch Account" button** on fitness profile page
3. **Complete profile in one session** without navigating away
4. **Clear browser cookies** if issues persist

### Testing Steps:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in incognito mode
2. Create new account via signup
3. Immediately go to fitness profile (don't navigate away)
4. Complete all 4 steps without refreshing
5. Submit profile

### Long-term Fix:
Consider implementing JWT tokens in localStorage alongside cookies for more reliable authentication in development.
